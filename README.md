UVM Component Development and Integration

This repository showcases the development and gradual integration of UVM components from scratch. The project includes a comprehensive UVM environment with key components such as agents, drivers, monitors, scoreboards, and virtual interfaces. Each component is implemented by extending the appropriate UVM base classes (uvm_driver, uvm_monitor, uvm_agent, etc) and includes detailed configuration, build, connect, and run phases to ensure proper initialization and execution.

The development process involved:

Successfully developing and executing each component individually.
Gradually integrating each component into the overall testbench architecture.
Creating sequences and sequence items to generate stimulus for the DUT (Device Under Test).
Incorporating functional coverage and scoreboard checks. Implementing virtual interfaces to facilitate seamless communication between the testbench components and the DUT.
